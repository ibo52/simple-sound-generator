# simple-sound-generator
## very simple sine waves generator program to produce sound.
1. _Environment: Ubuntu/GNU-Linux; g++_
2. _Makefile appended. Compile the program with it_
  * _'make all' command compiles and places code to a directory_
  * _'make remove' command deletes directory. Or you can delete directory manually_
* "monophonic_nenni bebek.wav" :
  * An example monophonic melody from the Tunceli region of Turkey.
  * Produced by using the program
* "sound_assemble.py" and "sound_assemble.png" :
  * an example sound programmed by averaging different octaves of same musical note, like the image below.
  * To visualise the combining of different sound frequencies into one. Idea will be implement later
  * sound assemble.py plots sample frequencies on window. .png is output of this code.
  * ![sample visualization](sound_assemble.png)
